<p>I had writen a new story for week two but decided not to use it. The new story has a follows the same theme I had in my first story, which was about how I understand that one's life could have purpose. What's different is that this story illustrates the point at which I had my revelation. I hadn't considered it for week three, but since we get to do our own flow chart this week, I figured I would give it a go. It's not lost on me that the themes I have picked are more suited for a long form narative and even in my prose, I am squezzing so much into just a little over one page. Recently, I realized that I needed articulate a personal mission statement. And since mobile debelopment is going to be part of who I am, I will bring myself into it, literarily. Pun intended.
